In the admission block, fate intertwined,
Yvonne Mueni, a beauty so refined.
Amidst the bustle, our paths did meet,
A moment so sweet, a memory complete.

Her eyes, like stars, a gleam so bright,
Guiding me through the maze of the night.
In her smile, I found a gentle grace,
A warmth that held me in its embrace.

With each word spoken, a melody untold,
Her laughter, a symphony, pure gold.
In her presence, time took flight,
Lost in the magic of her light.

Yvonne Mueni, a name etched in my heart,
A love story about to embark.
In the halls of Embu, our journey begins,
Where every moment, our love wins.

So here's my ode, my love declared,
For Yvonne Mueni, beyond compare.
In every rhyme, in every line,
My heart's song for you, forever thine.
